Hi there! I am an NLP researcher passionate about understanding and evaluating the language capabilities of AI models.

In 2023, I completed a Masters in Computer Science and Bachelors in Linguistics at Stanford University, where I conducted research advised by <a href="https://stanford.edu/~cgpotts/">Dr. Christopher Potts</a> and <a href="https://atticusg.github.io/">Dr. Atticus Geiger</a>.

My research focuses on <strong>causally-motivated explanations and evaluation</strong> of language models. At Stanford, I worked on interpretable, de-biased, and accessible language models. At the <a href="https://prair.group/">Pr(Ai)<sup>2</sup>R Group</a>, I researched the decision-making of language models during free-form text generation, and its implications on representation bias in short story generation.

Right now, I am a data scientist at Microsoft, working on multi-turn conversational agents.
