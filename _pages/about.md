Hi there! I am an NLP researcher passionate about understanding how AI models learn and process language.

I completed my MS in Computer Science and BA in Linguistics at Stanford University, where I conducted research on <strong>causally-motivated explanation and evaluation</strong> of language models advised by <a href="https://stanford.edu/~cgpotts/">Dr. Christopher Potts</a> and <a href="https://atticusg.github.io/">Dr. Atticus Geiger</a>.

My Honors thesis at Stanford focused on interpretable, de-biased, and accessible language models. At the <a href="https://prair.group/">Pr(Ai)<sup>2</sup>R Group</a>, I researched the decision-making of language models during text generation. Right now, I am a data scientist at Microsoft working on interactive and explainable agents.
